    "This code uses TwitterAPI, a 3rd party library approved by the Twitter Developer team, with Twitter's Premium Search Tweets (Full Archive) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For TwitterAPI's documentation, see https://readthedocs.org/projects/twitterapi/downloads/pdf/latest/. There are many libraries that are compatible with the Standard APIs but TwitterAPI is one of the very few compatible with Premium APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Premium Search Tweets API endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two premium search API endpoints: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search Tweets: 30-day endpoint → provides Tweets posted within the last 30 days.\n",
    "2. Search Tweets: Full-archive endpoint → provides Tweets from as early as 2006, starting with the first Tweet posted in March 2006.\n",
    "\n",
    "Premium search provides data and counts endpoints. Data endpoints retrieve Tweets matching the specified query. Count endpoints retrieve the number of Tweets matching the specified query. For this project, I will be using the data endpoints. \n",
    "\n",
    "The search URL for the data endpoint is:\n",
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/tweets/search/fullarchive/dev.json\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate limits\n",
    "Request rate limits at both minute and second granularity. The per minute rate limit is 60 requests per minute (30 with Sandbox environment). Requests are also limited to 10 per second. Requests are aggregated across both the data and counts endpoints. Monthly request limits are also applied. Sandbox environments are limited to 250 requests per month, and paid access can range between 500 and 10,000 requests.\n",
    "(from https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/premium-search#SearchRequests)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences with the Standard Search API\n",
    "For information on how the Search Tweets API (Premium) and the Twitter Search API (Standard), see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/guides/integrating-premium (\"Migrating from standard search\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting the JSON-encoded tweet objects\n",
    "For information on the Tweet JSON returned by the Search Tweets API, see https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/intro-to-tweet-json."

    "\n",
    "There are two versions of the Premium Search Tweets API: Sandbox and Premium (paid). The Sandbox version is free and is already set up when you create your dev environment. This allows for testing and permits 50 requests a month of 100 tweets each (5k tweets overall). The Premium version must be paid for each month and varies by price depending on how many requests you purchase. With the Premium version, each request gives you 500 tweets. Therefore, at the lowest purchase level of 100 requests, you would get 50k tweets overall.\n",
